# IgboLang: Python in Igbo

## Introduction
IgboLang is a Python extension that allows you to write and run programs in Igbo, a language widely spoken in Nigeria. It preserves Python 3 syntax and methods, making it an excellent tool for learning programming in your native language.

## Example Usage
IgboLang is easy to use. Below is a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```bash
python igbolang.py
```

**Interactive Session:**
```
IgboLang, the programming language in Igbo (Interactive Interpreter)
igbl>> deputa("Uwa Aloo")
```

**Output:**
```
Uwa Aloo  # Equivalent to "Hello, World!"
```
